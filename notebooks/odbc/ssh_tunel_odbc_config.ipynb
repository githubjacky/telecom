    "*The tutorial is for the Mac or Linux user. As a mac user, I use \n",
    "homebrew as my package manager. For linux user you should be able to find the \n",
    "right package and download it from your own package manager.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the tutorial, I will demonstrate how to connect to a remote \n",
    "server's MySQL database from your local machine or any other machine which the \n",
    "database isn't stored on. \n",
    "The concept is to let the remote database server \n",
    "listen to the local port you open.\n",
    "In the second part, I will show you how to setup the \n",
    "ODBC(Open Database Connectivity) allowing prgramming language such as Python,\n",

    "to the BDSRC HPC. After connect to the master branch of the HPC, let the \n",
    "remote MySQL database connect to your local MySQL database through the port \n",
    "you just created which is 3336. The local port 3336 can be customized and \n",
    "just remember not to use 3306. While the remote port is fixed to 3306 since MySQL \n",
    "will listen to this port by default. Plus, that's the reason why not setting the \n",
    "local port to 3306. To see the meaning of the flag: f, N and L, refer to the man page.\n",
